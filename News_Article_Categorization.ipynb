She had ridden the subway that morning with her owner, Katrina Krings. Krings took along Stellas toy lamb and made sure that her secret weapon salami from Katzs Delicatessen on the Lower East Side was waiting when they finished their first turn in the ring. When they arrived at Pier 94 in Manhattan, Stella weaved her way through an obstacle course filled with tunnels and jumps in front of hundreds of hometown fans. Stella had competed in Staten Island and New Jersey, but her owner said there was something special about being a part of Westminster.This is so exciting for me, Krings, a 31-year-old dog trainer, said as Stella relaxed after her first trial by snacking on salami and chewing on her toy lamb.This year, Westminster added the agility championship to its traditional two-day best-in-show contest, which begins Monday and includes 2,845 dogs. Agility events, which are common at other shows, display other aspects of dogs, such as skill and speed.The new competition has opened Westminsters festivities to mixed-breed dogs, which have not been allowed to participate in the main event. (Westminster noted that dogs other than purebreds could compete in the shows early years, from 1877 to 1884, when its rules were inexact.)About 225 dogs, including 15 mixed breeds, were entered in Saturdays agility drills. Each animal took the ring twice for qualifying rounds, with the best performers moving to the championship round. The dogs, representing 63 breeds from 23 states, were randomly selected from a pool of 653 entrants.The dogs and their owners had a range of stories about the ways they had wound up together and in New York for the competition.A 4-year-old papillon from North Carolina, Reese, was surrendered to a rescue organization as a puppy because his original owner thought he had too much energy. His new owner, Toni Moody, an X-ray technician, doubles as Reeses handler. Moody found a way to channel his energy. Working with a trainer, Reese now competes in trials about twice a month. He became a bit of a celebrity last week when The Charlotte Observer published an article about his appearance at Westminster.Arriving in New York on Thursday, Reese had a few days to get used to the weather, even wearing a jacket. He is a Southern dog now, Moody said.In the ring, Reese, whose trainer calls him a Jet Ski because of the way his tail looks when he runs, did not qualify for the championship round. But Moody was not upset.She told Reese, We are very proud of you, arent we?BORDER COLLIE WINS Kelso, a Border collie owned by Delaney Ratner of Cape Elizabeth, Me., navigated a maze of obstacles to win the Westminster agility competition. A husky mix named Roo, owned by the trainer Stacey Campbell of San Francisco, received the award for the best mixed-breed dog. (AP)\",\n          \"Business BriefingDec. 16, 2015New cars and trucks averaged a record 24.3 miles a gallon last year, but falling gas prices and Americas rekindled love affair with S.U.V.s could endanger gains. The Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday that fuel economy rose in 2014 by 0.2 m.p.g., from 24.1 m.p.g. in 2013, as the benefits of technical improvements were nearly offset by resurgent consumer demand for larger vehicles. That is a second straight year of modest gains after efficiency improved a more robust 1.2 m.p.g. from 2011 to 2012. Still, automakers exceeded overall federal targets by a wide margin. Chris Grundler, director of the agencys Office of Air Quality and Transportation, predicted slow growth again for 2015.\",\n          \"Science|High Above Mars, a NASA Orbiter Spies the Curiosity Roverhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/science/mars-curiosity-reconnaissance-orbiter.htmlTrilobitesJune 22, 2017ImageCredit...NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory/University of ArizonaThe small blue dot is Curiosity.From orbit, NASAs Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been cataloging the landscape of Mars in exquisite detail for more than a decade. Occasionally it photographs something not at all Martian.On June 5, the orbiter passed over Mount Sharp, the mountain inside a crater where NASAs Curiosity rover has been exploring since 2012. The color image, taken from a distance of 169 miles, is the combined view of three wavelength bands red, blue-green and infrared. Those wavelengths bring out differences in the materials on Marss surface, but produce a scene quite different in hue from what the human eye would see.This false-color combination makes Curiosity, which is about 10 feet long and nine feet wide, pop out as a bright blue in the terrain of tan rocks and patches of dark sand. (The rover usually has a hue like an unwashed metallic car.)The Reconnaissance Orbiter has been taking pictures of Curiosity about every three months to monitor movements in dunes, erosion of slopes and other changes in the landscape.Curiosity is not the only Earth visitor that has been spotted. In 2006, the orbiter took this image of the Opportunity rover, which showed not only the rover but also the tracks in the soil and even the shadow of its camera mast.ImageCredit...NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory/University of ArizonaThe camera has also taken pictures of NASAs Viking and Phoenix landers. A Russian amateur may have also spotted Mars 3, the Soviet spacecraft that set down on Mars in 1971, although that identification was not conclusive.The orbiter has also provided hints into Mars spacecraft that failed.When the European Space Agencys Schiaparelli craft, part of its ExoMars mission, disappeared last year as it was descending, the Reconnaissance Orbiter spotted a dark scar on the surface where the lander crashed.ImageCredit...NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory/University of ArizonaThe orbiter also found Beagle 2, an earlier European Space Agency lander that disappeared in 2003. In that instance, it turned out that Beagle 2 made it to the surface in one piece but not all of its solar panels deployed. With the radio antenna blocked, it was never able to send a message back to Earth.ImageCredit...NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory/University of Arizona/University of LeicesterOne spacecraft, however, still eludes discovery NASAs Polar Lander that disappeared without a trace in December 1999 as it was heading toward a spot on Mars near the South Pole.Mars Reconnaissance Orbiters camera has taken images covering the area where Polar Lander is likely to be, but it remains hidden in the rough terrain. In the years since its disappearance, the debris may have also been partly hidden by dust and frost.ImageCredit...NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory/University of Arizona\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Category\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"science\",\n          \"World\",\n          \"Entertainment\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

She had ridden the subway that morning with her owner, Katrina Krings. Krings took along Stellas toy lamb and made sure that her secret weapon salami from Katzs Delicatessen on the Lower East Side was waiting when they finished their first turn in the ring. When they arrived at Pier 94 in Manhattan, Stella weaved her way through an obstacle course filled with tunnels and jumps in front of hundreds of hometown fans. Stella had competed in Staten Island and New Jersey, but her owner said there was something special about being a part of Westminster.This is so exciting for me, Krings, a 31-year-old dog trainer, said as Stella relaxed after her first trial by snacking on salami and chewing on her toy lamb.This year, Westminster added the agility championship to its traditional two-day best-in-show contest, which begins Monday and includes 2,845 dogs. Agility events, which are common at other shows, display other aspects of dogs, such as skill and speed.The new competition has opened Westminsters festivities to mixed-breed dogs, which have not been allowed to participate in the main event. (Westminster noted that dogs other than purebreds could compete in the shows early years, from 1877 to 1884, when its rules were inexact.)About 225 dogs, including 15 mixed breeds, were entered in Saturdays agility drills. Each animal took the ring twice for qualifying rounds, with the best performers moving to the championship round. The dogs, representing 63 breeds from 23 states, were randomly selected from a pool of 653 entrants.The dogs and their owners had a range of stories about the ways they had wound up together and in New York for the competition.A 4-year-old papillon from North Carolina, Reese, was surrendered to a rescue organization as a puppy because his original owner thought he had too much energy. His new owner, Toni Moody, an X-ray technician, doubles as Reeses handler. Moody found a way to channel his energy. Working with a trainer, Reese now competes in trials about twice a month. He became a bit of a celebrity last week when The Charlotte Observer published an article about his appearance at Westminster.Arriving in New York on Thursday, Reese had a few days to get used to the weather, even wearing a jacket. He is a Southern dog now, Moody said.In the ring, Reese, whose trainer calls him a Jet Ski because of the way his tail looks when he runs, did not qualify for the championship round. But Moody was not upset.She told Reese, We are very proud of you, arent we?BORDER COLLIE WINS Kelso, a Border collie owned by Delaney Ratner of Cape Elizabeth, Me., navigated a maze of obstacles to win the Westminster agility competition. A husky mix named Roo, owned by the trainer Stacey Campbell of San Francisco, received the award for the best mixed-breed dog.

The Environmental Protection Agency said on Wednesday that fuel economy rose in 2014 by 0.2 m.p.g., from 24.1 m.p.g. in 2013, as the benefits of technical improvements were nearly offset by resurgent consumer demand for larger vehicles. That is a second straight year of modest gains after efficiency improved a more robust 1.2 m.p.g. from 2011 to 2012. Still, automakers exceeded overall federal targets by a wide margin. Chris Grundler, director of the agencys Office of Air Quality and Transportation, predicted slow growth again for 2015.\",\n          \"Science|High Above Mars, a NASA Orbiter Spies the Curiosity Roverhttps://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/science/mars-curiosity-reconnaissance-orbiter.htmlTrilobitesJune 22, 2017ImageCredit...NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory/University of ArizonaThe small blue dot is Curiosity.From orbit, NASAs Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been cataloging the landscape of Mars in exquisite detail for more than a decade. Occasionally it photographs something not at all Martian.On June 5, the orbiter passed over Mount Sharp, the mountain inside a crater where NASAs Curiosity rover has been exploring since 2012. The color image, taken from a distance of 169 miles, is the combined view of three wavelength bands red, blue-green and infrared. Those wavelengths bring out differences in the materials on Marss surface, but produce a scene quite different in hue from what the human eye would see.This false-color combination makes Curiosity, which is about 10 feet long and nine feet wide, pop out as a bright blue in the terrain of tan rocks and patches of dark sand. (The rover usually has a hue like an unwashed metallic car.)The Reconnaissance Orbiter has been taking pictures of Curiosity about every three months to monitor movements in dunes, erosion of slopes and other changes in the landscape.Curiosity is not the only Earth visitor that has been spotted. In 2006, the orbiter took this image of the Opportunity rover, which showed not only the rover but also the tracks in the soil and even the shadow of its camera mast.ImageCredit...NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory/University of ArizonaThe camera has also taken pictures of NASAs Viking and Phoenix landers. A Russian amateur may have also spotted Mars 3, the Soviet spacecraft that set down on Mars in 1971, although that identification was not conclusive.The orbiter has also provided hints into Mars spacecraft that failed.When the European Space Agencys Schiaparelli craft, part of its ExoMars mission, disappeared last year as it was descending, the Reconnaissance Orbiter spotted a dark scar on the surface where the lander crashed.ImageCredit...NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory/University of ArizonaThe orbiter also found Beagle 2, an earlier European Space Agency lander that disappeared in 2003. In that instance, it turned out that Beagle 2 made it to the surface in one piece but not all of its solar panels deployed. With the radio antenna blocked, it was never able to send a message back to Earth.ImageCredit...NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory/University of Arizona/University of LeicesterOne spacecraft, however, still eludes discovery NASAs Polar Lander that disappeared without a trace in December 1999 as it was heading toward a spot on Mars near the South Pole.Mars Reconnaissance Orbiters camera has taken images covering the area where Polar Lander is likely to be, but it remains hidden in the rough terrain. In the years since its disappearance, the debris may have also been partly hidden by dust and frost.ImageCredit...NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory/University of Arizona\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 2,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 7,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 8,\n        \"samples\": [\n          7,\n          6,\n          1\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
